    "1. Identify target website.\n",
    "2. Learn how the website constructs their URL so we can retrieve the desired page from the website.\n",
    "3. Programmatically retrieve websites with the URL we reverse-engineered from the website.\n",
    "4. Use libraries to traverse and obtain information we need from website.\n",
    "5. Organise the information and return in desired format.\n"

    "For example, look at the URL in **Step 1**. The ticker symbol of the Apple is **AAPL**. Notice that **AAPL** repeats twice in the URL. \n",
